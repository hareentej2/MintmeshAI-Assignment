Add ltering, sorting, and paging on elds wherever you feel required.
Follow best practices to implement the REST API
You can develop REST API using Flask or Django.

Problem 2
Please write code which is bug free, meet coding standards, and takes care of all the possible edge
cases. So make sure that it is production ready
